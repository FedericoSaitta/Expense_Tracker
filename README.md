# Expense_Tracker

Started on 21/09/2023, this is an expense tracker that is easily usable by any Revolut account holder. 
Im not pleased with their built in analytics system so I decided to make my own version that is able to achieve what the Revolut app can do but also has a slight more flexibility. 
The negatives include that my built graphics are rudimentary in comparison to the App and my program can be slightly more 
cumbersome to work with even though it can achieve greater flexibility when it comes to including or excluding certain expenses. 

## Data Filer: 
Filters data from CSV file based on user preferece, user can exclude certain transactions, certain vendors, or exclude certain months when plotting their expense analytics. 
User can also plot analytics for a single month: smooth cumulative line chart, or for many months of the year: bar plot.
