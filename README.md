# Expense_Tracker

Started on 21/09/2023 and finished on 23/09/2023 this is an expense tracker for my Revolut account, Im not pleased with their built in 
analytics system so I decided to make my own version that is able to achieve what the Revolut app can do but also has a slight more flexibility. The negatives include that my built graphics are rudimentary in comparison to the App and my program can be slightly more 
cumbersome to work with even though it can achieve greater flexibility when it comes to including or excluding certain expenses. 

I would definetely like to come back to this program and maybe even add some more functionalities such as a way to track your savings account and I would also like to improve the graphics of the plots.
